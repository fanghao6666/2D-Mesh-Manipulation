# 2D Mesh Manipulation Demo

    This is a 2D Mesh Manipulation demo based on Mean Value Coordinates.
    You can draw an arbitrary polygon with the mouse,and drag control points to
    manipulate the 2D mesh.This project is based on VS2015,maybe other version can also work.
## Development Environment
   * VS2015 
   * OpenGL
   * [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page)
   * [Fade2d](https://www.geom.at/fade2d/html/)
   
   NOTICE: Our project is based on Fade2d_x64_release,so please select the correct fade2d configuration version.
   
## How To Work
   * First,download the code and open with vs2015,then config development environment,compile it with X64_release.
   * Operation:
        * Righ_Mouse_Click --- Draw Contour Points
